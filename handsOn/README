# Content

Contains several version of the same code, which mimics the structure
of a simplified atmospheric model having only physical parametrizations
and output.

The code is structured as follows:

main.f90                main driver, calls init, time loop, and output
m_config.f90            configuration information domain size, number of steps
m_fields.f90            global fields
m_io.f90                output routine
m_parametrization.f90   physical parametrizations doing the actual computation
m_physics.f90           driver for the physical paramtrization
m_setup.f90             code initialization and clean up
m_timing                timing routines


# Compilation

make example_<name>

For example, in order to compile the serial version of the example, you
can execute the following command:

make example_serial

This creates an executable example_serial/example_serial which can then
be run.
